# TAVWA - TheAarjav Vulnerable Web Application

**TAVWA** (TheAarjav Vulnerable Web Application) is an intentionally insecure PHP/MySQL web application created by **Aarjav Sharma** for educational and penetration testing exercises in a safe, controlled environment.

This project is inspired by the concept of intentionally vulnerable applications (such as DVWA & XVWA) and contains multiple well-known web security flaws for students and researchers to practice secure coding and ethical hacking skills.

‚ö† **Disclaimer**  
Do NOT host TAVWA on a live or production server. It is deliberately insecure and must only be used in an offline lab or isolated virtual machine. The author is not responsible for any misuse.

## Features

TAVWA includes labs and scenarios for the following vulnerabilities:

- **SQL Injection** (Error-based & Blind)
- **OS Command Injection**
- **XPATH Injection**
- **Formula Injection**
- **PHP Object Injection**
- **Unrestricted File Upload**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** ‚Äî Reflected, Stored, DOM-based
- **Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) / Cross Site Port Attacks**
- **File Inclusion** (Local / Remote)
- **Session Management Flaws**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)**
- **Missing Functional Access Control**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
- **Weak Cryptography**
- **Unvalidated Redirects & Forwards**
- **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)**

## Installation

1. **Clone or Download:**
```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/TAVWA.git
```

2. **Move to Web Directory:**
- For XAMPP (Windows):
  ```
  C:\xampp\htdocs\TAVWA
  ```
- For Linux LAMP:
  ```
  /var/www/html/TAVWA
  ```

3. **Create Database:**
- Access phpMyAdmin or MySQL
- Create a database, e.g., `tavwa`
- Import the SQL file from the `db/` folder

4. **Edit Configuration:**
- Open `config/config.inc.php`
- Set your MySQL username, password, and database name

5. **Run in Browser:**
```
http://localhost/TAVWA/
```
